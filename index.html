                <p class="text-salmon">My name is Felicity van Dam, I'm a 16 year old girl and I live in the
                    Netherlands. My hometown is a city called Delft where I live with my mom and many animals. I'm a
                    very social girl and enjoy talking which makes it not hard for me to help people or work in groups.
                    I think of myself as a person who takes a leader role easy but I can also let someone else take the
                    lead when it's necessary. </p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-salmon">Hobby's</h3>
            <p class="text-salmon">One of my main hobby's is horseback riding, every Friday I take a lesson from 7
                to 8.
                In my free time I also do a lot of video editing and I have been doing that for about 3 years now, I
                also know my wat around editing photo's. I do a lot of reading in my free time that can differ from
                online stories to real live books, I mostly read thrillers or romans but I also sometimes enjoy a
                comedy
                book. And like almost every teen I enjoy playing videos games.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center text-salmon">School</h3>
            <p class="text-salmon">From age 12 to 16 I went to a high school called SC-Delfland that Is located in
                Delft next to the train station. In my last 2 years there I did economics so I learned a lot about
                how I need to present myself as a worker and how I need to act and look to correctly present a
                business. But I also learned many thing about correctly documenting things in order for you to find
                documents or projects easily. I am now studying software developer at ROC Mondriaan who is located
                in The Hague.</p>

                        who is called “John's snoepkraam”. It's a small candy shop located in a market in the city
                        called Rijswijk. I have been working there for 9 years now every weekend. A lot of my social
                        work experience comes from working here, I learned how to be friendly with costumers and
                        also how to fix issues with costumers.</p>
