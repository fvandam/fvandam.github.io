                            My name is Felicity van Dam, I am 17 years old, and I live in the Netherlands. My place of
                            birth is a city called Delft, where I reside with my mother and 2 birds. I am a very social
                            person, and I enjoy talking, which makes it easy for me to help people or work in groups. I
                            consider myself someone who can easily take on a leadership role, but I can also let someone
                            else take the lead if necessary.</p>

                    <p class="text-white ps-4">One of my biggest hobbies is horseback riding. Every Friday, I take
                        lessons from 7 to 8. In my
                        free time, I also do a <br> lot of video editing, which I've been doing for about 3 years now. I
                        can
                        also edit photos. I enjoy reading a lot in my spare time, both online and regular books. I
                        mostly read thrillers or novels, but sometimes I also enjoy a fun <br> comedy. And like almost
                        every
                        teenager, I enjoy playing video games.</p>

                        <p class="text-white ms-4">
                            From the age of 12 until I was 16, I attended a secondary school called SC-Delfland, located
                            in Delft next to the train station. In my last two years there, I studied economics, so I
                            learned a lot about how to present myself as an employee and how to behave and appear to
                            properly represent a company. I also learned a great deal about proper document
                            organization, making it easy to retrieve documents when needed. Currently, I am studying
                            software development at ROC Mondriaan in The Hague.</p>
